## What is it?

**Shhh** is a tiny Flask app to create encrypted secrets and share 
them securely with people. The goal of this application is to get rid
of plain text sensitive information into emails or chat logs.  

Shhh is deployed [here](https://shhh-encrypt.herokuapp.com/), but
**it's better for organisations and people to deploy it on their own
personal / private server** for even better security. You can find
in this repo everything you need to host the app yourself.  

Or you can **one-click deploy to Heroku** using the below button.
It will generate a fully configured private instance of Shhh 
immediately (using your own server and Postgres database, for free).  

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh)

## How does it work?

The sender has to set an expiration date along with a passphrase to
protect the information he wants to share.  

A unique link is generated by Shhh that the sender can share with the
receiver in an email, alongside the temporary passphrase he created
in order to reveal the secret.  

The secret will be **permanently removed** from the database as soon 
as one of these events happens:  

* the expiration date has passed (max 7 days). 
* the receiver has decrypted the message. 
* or the amount of tries to open the secret has exceeded (max 10). 

The secrets are encrypted in order to make the data anonymous, 
especially in the database, and the passphrases are not stored 
anywhere.  

_Encryption method used: Fernet with password, random salt value and
strong iteration count (100 000)._  

_Tip: For added security, avoid telling in Shhh what is the use of
the secret you're sharing. Instead, explain this in your email, and 
copy the Shhh link to it with the passphrase._  

## Is there an API?

Yes, you can find the doc [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/smallwat3r/shhh-api/1.0.0).  

Also, checkout [shhh-cli](https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh-cli), 
a Go client to interact with the Shhh API from the terminal.  


## What's the stack?

### Core application
* **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)**, used as
our Python backend web-framework.  
* **[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)** used to store only: 
the unique links, the encrypted messages, the creation and expiration
dates.  
* **[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)**, the CSS framework.  


### Tools
* **[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/)**, check database records.  


## What are the dependencies?

You can find the list of the Python dependencies 
[here](https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh/blob/master/requirements.txt), 
and the list of the frontend dependencies 
[here](https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh/blob/master/package.json).

## How to launch Shhh locally?

These methods are for development purpose only. For production / 
public use you might want to use a more secure configuration.

<details>
<summary><b>Launch it natively</b></summary>

#### Postgres  

You will need a Postgres server running on localhost in the 
background. Create a database named Shhh.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS shhh;
```

#### Flask  

```sh 
git clone https://github.com/smallwat3r/shhh.git && cd shhh
```

We recommend that you create a Python virtual environment for this 
project, so you can install the required dependencies.  

```sh
python -m venv env 
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r test-requirements.txt  # optional
```

Install the frontend dependencies:
```sh
# need yarn (brew install yarn) or (sudo apt install yarn)
yarn install
```

Stay in the virtual environment created.  

You then need to set up a few environment variables. These will be 
used to configure Flask, as well as the application connection to the 
database.  

```sh
export FLASK_APP=shhh
export FLASK_ENV=dev-local

export POSTGRES_HOST=<host>
export POSTGRES_DB=<database>
export POSTGRES_USER=<username>
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password>
export POSTGRES_PORT=<port>

# Launch the app
flask run
```

You can now access the app at http://localhost:5000  

**Note**: To make developing locally easier, and to avoid having to 
re-set the env variables every time, you can fill in values the local
env template at `envs/local.dev.template` and rename the file to 
`envs/local.dev`  

Then, run the command below to launch a local flask server
```
make local
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Launch it with docker-compose</b></summary>

#### docker-compose  

You will need Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine.

```sh
docker-compose up --build  # start app
docker-compose stop        # stop app
```

or via Makefile:

```sh
make dc-start  # start app
made dc-stop   # stop app
```

Once the container image has finished building and starting, you can
access:  

* Shhh at http://localhost:5000
* Database records using Adminer at http://localhost:8080

Note: using docker-compose the application is running with Gunicorn.

## Run the checks

```sh
make tests   # run tests
make lint    # run pylint report
make secure  # run bandit report
make mypy    # run mypy report

make checks  # run all checks
```
